- 👋 Hi, I’m Aditya Vishwakarma.
-  I am for a longest time been working on my ideas and want them to manifest and evolve them into reality (inventions and innovations).
- 👀 I’m interested in working on my ideas and I enjoy it. A lot of my ideas are on drawing borad and are only conceptualized.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various new topics related to technology, coding and various fields that I find interesting. I'm a math enthusiast and and have done some of my works in number theory.
- 💞️ I’m not much into collaboration. I like to do things on my own. But, you can modify my work and use it.
