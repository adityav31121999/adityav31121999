- 👋 Hi, I’m Aditya Vishwakarma.
-  I am for a longest time been working on my ideas and want them to manifest and evolve them into reality (inventions and innovations).
- 👀 I’m interested in working on my ideas and I enjoy it. A lot of my ideas are on drawing borad and are only conceptualized.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various new topics related to technology, coding and various fields that I find interesting. I'm a math enthusiast and and have done some of my works in number theory.
- 💞️ I’m not much into collaboration. I like to do things on my own. But, you can modify my work and use it.
- 📫 If you want to reach me, use my email adityav31121999@gmail.com. My alternate mail account is adityav31121999@mail.com, and preferable is Gmail one.

  - Divided Context Architecture (DCA) for Long Context LLMs
  - tokeniser (bpe)

  - ViT-CC
  - MonoNN
  - Morphers

- IMP:
  - WHEN I FEEL LIKE THERE IS NEED OF FAST ERROR RESOLUTION AND WHEN I DON'T KNOW A CONCEPT I VIBE CODE AND IN PROCESS LEARN THOSE CONCEPTS TOO. Hence, sometimes after learning and experimenting these concepts, i modify them to my needs and then use them.
